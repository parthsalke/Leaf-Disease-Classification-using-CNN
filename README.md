# Leaf-Disease-Classification-using-CNN


Built a deep learning Convolutional neural networks project to classify disease in potato plant as either early blight or late blight. 
We have created a webpage which can input as picture of the plant and tell the farmer if the plant has a disease or not. 
Successfully achieved a Training and Validation accuracy of 98% and achieved a Training and validation loss of 0.183%.
Deployed the model to Google Cloud Platform by using buckets function.
Technology of this project consists of tensorflow, tf dataset, FastAPI, data augmentation, react js, react native, Google cloud platform (for deployment), quantization, tf lite.
